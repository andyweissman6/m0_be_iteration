# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
It can be useful in instances where every single element of an array is trying to have something perfomed on.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
I need to complete a couple more practice problems involving github: specifically pushing. 
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this assignment?
I understood the notation and what was being performed, but was having major difficulties with minor mess-ups within my terminal. Frustration kicked in because I knew what I was doing, but my return wasn't showing it!
